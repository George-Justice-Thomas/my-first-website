        <!--An intro about me!-->
        <p>Hello! My name is George but I usually go by Justice. I live in the United States in the state of New Jersey. I'm currently 21, and enjoy music and video games. Recently I've found an interest in coding that leads me to learn more about the technology I'm using and the many unheard languages that they communicate with. 
        I hope to make something that helps to impact the world!
        That being said, I'm a determined individual who plans to master the ways of coding!</p>
        <p>Here are some fun facts about me:</p>
<!--An unordered,or bullet list. I made sure to label each bullet with li or list 
        item-->
        <ul>
  <li>played the alto and baritone saxophone in high school</li>
  <li>was on the bowling team during my sophomore year of high school</li>
  <li>was on the tennis team during my senior year of high school</li>
 <!--Inside of this listed item, I created an anchor to wrap around Project M, 
          that when clicked will take you to the wikipedia page.-->
          <li>hosted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_M">Project M</a> tournament during my senior year of high school</li>

        <h2 class="george">The George Lore</h2>
        <p>I enjoy simple things and the like. 
        After graduating from Dwight Morrow High School I went to Rutgers Newark unsure of what I wanted to major in. 
        Feeling like the college life wasn't right for me, I decided to leave college and join the work force.</p>
        <p>I worked for many different places, here is my list of my top 3 jobs I have worked at in the past:</p>
        <!--here is an ordered, or numbered list, of my top 3 favorite jobs I 
        have worked-->
        <ol>
          <li class="tape">Tape Press Operator</li>
          <li class="bake">Baker</li>
          <li class="coffee">Barista</li>
         
        </ol>
        
       <p> That being said,my favorite was the tape press warehouse in Bergenfield, where we would print logos on rolls of tape.</p>  
        <p>I started off learning as a press operator assistant,
        <!--So I tried to use in-line styling to make a specific text string the 
        color red.-->
        <span style="color:red;">"P.O.I.N.T."</span> 
        it was called. 
        due to my intrigue in the press machines themselves I sought help from operators who I had become friends with to teach me during off time. 
        I was then assigned to a new machine and had finally become what I had been working towards.</p> 
        <p>I was proud to be a machine operator and the ability to have a schedule that went by as fast as you pushed the product out was something I enjoyed.
        But this job gave me the same problem that other jobs in the past have provided: anxiety.
        And a lot of it.
         After work days I found myself socially drained, nervous of my decisions and how they would impact me, a feeling of inadequacy for feeling these feelings, and an overall lack of enthusiasm from me.</p>
        <p>Cut to now, where I've found an interest in learning to develop software and write code.
        It feels like a spark is lit somewhere inside my heart. 
        I feel the material to be immensely rewarding and a remote environment that retains a cooperative staff through virtual calls is something I believe I would benefit greatly from.</p>
